Dependencies

    This extension requires GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl.
    
    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 1.40
    (#version 140) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.10
    (#version 310) and higher.

    All these versions map GLSL/ESSL semantics to the same SPIR-V 1.0
    semantics (approximating the most recent versions of GLSL/ESSL).
    
    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
    Specification, Version 4.60.7, Wed, 10 Jul 2019.

Overview

    This extension is built upon the new language features added by
    GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl, but relaxes some of it's changes and restrictions
    to allow for compiling existing OpenGL GLSL and ESSL legal shaders
    without requiring any edits for Vulkan compliance.

    The following previously removed features are re-added:
        * default uniforms (uniform variables not inside a uniform block).
        * shared and packed block layouts, but they are silently ignored.
        * gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID
        * atomic-counters (those based on atomic_uint)
             
    New features:
        * The type of backing used for a block, push constant or uniform
          buffer, and the layout of the block, can be changed at compile
          time by the user of the GLSL front-end.
        * The set which a uniform blocks belong to can be changed at compile time
          by the user of the GLSL front-end.

    Each of these is discussed in more detail below.

    Enabling These Features
    -----------------------

    This extension is not enabled with a #extension as other extensions are.
    It is also not enabled through use of a profile or #version.  The intended
    level of GLSL/ESSL features, independent from Vulkan-specific usage, comes
    from the traditional use of #version, profile, and #extension.

    Instead, use of this extension is an effect of using a GLSL front-end in a
    mode that has it generate SPIR-V for Vulkan.  Such tool use is outside the
    scope of using the Vulkan API and outside the definition of GLSL and this
    extension. See the documentation of the compiler to see how to request
    generation of SPIR-V for Vulkan using these rules.

    When a front-end is used to accept this extension, it must error check and
    reject shaders not adhering to this specification, and accept those that
    do. Implementation-dependent maximums and capabilities are supplied to, or
    part of, the front-end, so it can do error checking against them.
             
    Default Uniforms
    ---------------
    
    All default uniforms will be silently grouped into a single anonymous
    uniform block. The block name of the block, the backing, set, and binding
    number can all be controlled via options to the GLSL front-end. If no
    name is given, the block name will be 'gl_DefaultUniformBlock'. 

    Shared and Packed Block Layouts
    -------------------------------
    
    If a block is declared with shared or packed layouts, those layouts will
    be ignored and instead the default layout for that block type will be used.
    
    gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID
    -----------------------------

    Built-in variables gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID are accepted, but are
    simply aliases to gl_VertexIndex and gl_InstanceIndex which were introduced
    in GL_EXT_vulkan_glsl. They will include the base offset like the
    GL_EXT_vulkan_glsl behavior.
    
    Atomic Counters
    ---------------
    
    atomic_uint declarations and functions inteacting with them will be
    silently converted to use storage buffers and related atomic functions.
    For each binding used for the atomic_uint variables, a different 
    buffer block will be allocated and the variables will be placed
    within that buffer using the variable's offset. The block name of
    the block and set number can all be controlled via options to the
    GLSL front-end. If no name is given, the block name will start with
    'gl_AtomicBufferBlock'. The block name will suffixed with '_<bindingNumber>'.
    Where <bindingNumber> is the original binding specified for the
    atomic_uints contained within that block. The actual binding of the
    block may be different than what was originally specified in the shader.
    Reflection should be used to find the final binding locations of these
    blocks.
   
Changes to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification

    Modify section 4.1.7 (Opaque Types)
    In the seciotn 'Atomic Counters', remove the line:

      Atomic counter types are not available when targeting Vulkan.

    Modify the section 4.3.5 (Uniform Variables)
    
    Remove the line:
      
      When targeting Vulkan, it is a compile-time error to declare uniform
      variables outside a block.

    Modify section 4.4.5 (Uniform and Shader Storage Block Layout Qualifiers)
      
    Remove the paragraphs describing the of the 'shared' and 'packed' layout qualifiers.
      
    Add the paragraph:
      
      Use of the 'shared' and 'packed' layout qualifiers will be silently ignored. The
      default layout for the block type will be used when these qualifiers are encountered.
      
    Modify the section 4.4.7 (Atomic Counter Layout Qualifiers)

    Add a paragraph at the end:
    
      Atomic Conters will be grouped into storage blocks with a name prefixed with
      gl_AtomicBufferBlock_ and the suffix being the binding number of the uniforms
      that were grouped into that block.

Changes to Chapter 7 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification

    Changes to section 7.1.1 (Built-In Language Variables)

      Replace the lines for non-ES with:

        in int gl_VertexID; // only present when not targeting Vulkan
        in int gl_InstanceID; // only present when not targeting Vulkan
        
      with:
        
        in int gl_VertexID; // Alias for gl_VertexIndex when targetting Vulkan
        in int gl_InstanceID; // Alias for gl_InstanceIndex when targetting Vulkan
        
     Remove the paragraphs defining gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID.
     
     Add the paragraph:
       gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID are aliases for gl_VertexIndex and
       gl_InstanceIndex respectively.
