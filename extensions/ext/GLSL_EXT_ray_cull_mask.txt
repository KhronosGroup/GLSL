Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.60
    (#version 460) and higher.

    This extension is written against revision 5 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.60, dated September 4, 2017.

    This extension interacts with revision 43 of the GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl
    extension, dated October 25, 2017.

    This extension requires GLSL_EXT_ray_tracing.

Overview

    This extension document adds support for the following extensions to be used
    within GLSL:

    - GL_EXT_ray_cull_mask - extends ray tracing operations.

    Mapping to SPIR-V
    -----------------

    For informational purposes (non-normative), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs:

      gl_CullMaskEXT -> CullMaskKHR decorated OpVariable

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_EXT_ray_cull_mask                           : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    New preprocessor #defines are added:

      #define GL_EXT_ray_cull_mask                              1

Additions to Chapter 7 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Built-in Variables)

    Modify Section 7.1, Built-in Languages Variables

    In the miss, any-hit, closest-hit and intersection shading languages, built-in variable is declared as follows

        // Ray cull mask
        in     uint  gl_CullMaskEXT;

    Add the following description for gl_CullMaskEXT:

    gl_CullMaskEXT is available in the intersection, any-hit, closest-hit and miss
    shading languages to specify the cull mask of the current ray. The value provided in this built-in
    is obtained from the lower 8 bits of the variable, the upper 24 bits are zero. See the Ray Tracing chapter of
    the Vulkan specification for more details.
