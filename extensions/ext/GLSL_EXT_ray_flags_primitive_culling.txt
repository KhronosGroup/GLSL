Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.60
    (#version 460) and higher.

    This extension is written against revision 5 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.60, dated September 4, 2017.

    This extension interacts with GL_EXT_ray_tracing.

    This extension interacts with GL_EXT_ray_query.

Overview

    This extension document modifies GLSL to add a layout qualifier and
    additional integer constants which can be used as ray flags under ray
    tracing or ray query extensions.
    

    This extension document adds support for the following extensions to be used
    within GLSL:

    - GL_EXT_ray_flags_primitive_culling - 

    Mapping to SPIR-V
    -----------------

    For informational purposes (non-normative), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs:

      gl_RayFlagsSkipTrianglesEXT -> SkipTrianglesKHR ray flag
      gl_RayFlagsSkipAABBEXT -> SkipAABBsKHR ray flag

    Using this extension defines the <RayTraversalPrimitiveCullingProvisionalKHR> 
    capability.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_EXT_ray_flags_primitive_culling : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    New preprocessor #defines are added:

      #define GL_EXT_ray_flags_primtive_culling          1


Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Variables and Types)

    Modify Section 4.4, Layout Qualifiers

    Modify the sentence that begins with "They can also appear with
    just an interface-qualifier" to add "or even without one"

    (Add additional line)
    layout-qualifier;


    Modify table in Section 4.4 (Layout Qualifiers)


    Layout Qualifier    Qualifier  Individual   Block    Block      Allowed
                          Only      Variable             Member    Interface
    -----------------   ---------  ----------   ------   ------    ---------

    primitive_culling      X                                         None


    Add a new subsection to Section 4.4

    4.4.10 Primitive Culling Layout Qualifier

    This layout qualifier can only be applied at global scope
    and without an interface-qualifier.

    It is a compile-time error to use this qualifier with an
    interface-qualifier, on an interface block or member of an interface
    block, or with any other layout qualifiers.


Additions to Chapter 7 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Built-in Variables)

    Modify Section 7.3, Built-in Constants

    Add a new subsection 7.3.x, "Fixed Constants"

    The following constants are provided in all shader stages when this
    extension is enabled

    const uint gl_RayFlagsSkipTrianglesEXT = 256U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsSkipAABBEXT = 512U;


Interactions with GL_EXT_ray_tracing/GL_EXT_ray_query

    Ray flags added by this extension can be used as flags for 'rayflags'
    argument for  traceRayEXT()/rayQueryInitializeEXT() call or for comparing 
    values to gl_IncomingRayFlagsEXT or the result of rayQueryGetRayFlagsEXT.

Issues

    TBD
