Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL Shading Language versions 4.50
    (#version 450) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES Shading Language versions 3.10
    (#version 310) and higher.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
    Specification, version 4.60, dated July 23, 2017.

    This extension interacts with OpenGL ES 3.2 and OES_sample_shading.

Overview

    This extension provides OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) support for the API
    extensions "NV_shading_rate_image" and "EXT_fragment_density_map". In
    those extensions, applications can use a texture to control the number of
    fragment shader invocations that will be spawned for a particular
    neighborhood of covered pixels. We refer to the density of fragment
    shader invocations as the "fragment invocation density". This
    extension provides useful functionality on it own, and does
    not require either of the companion extensions in order to be used.

    This extension provides GLSL built-in variables that allow the fragment
    shader to determine the fragment density used for a particular invocation.
    The gl_FragSizeEXT built-in indicates the width and height of the
    rectangle of pixels processed by this fragment shader invocation.
    The gl_FragInvocationCountEXT built-in indicates the maximum number of
    fragment invocations that will be executed for each fragment.

    Mapping to SPIR-V
    -----------------

    For informational purposes (non-normative), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs supported by the SPV_EXT_fragment_invocation_density
    extension:

    - gl_FragSizeEXT -> FragSizeEXT decorated variable
    - gl_FragInvocationCountEXT -> FragInvocationCountEXT decorated variable

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_EXT_fragment_invocation_density : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

      #define GL_EXT_fragment_invocation_density          1

    Modify Section 7.1, Built-In Language Variables, p. 122

    (add to the list of fragment language variables, middle of p. 124)

      in ivec2 gl_FragSizeEXT;
      in int   gl_FragInvocationCountEXT;

    (add documentation of the new built-in variables, before
     gl_HelperInvocation discussion at the bottom of p.128)

    The input variable gl_FragSizeEXT represents the size of a rectangle of
    pixels corresponding to this fragment shader invocation.  The first
    component is the width of the rectangle (in pixels); the second component
    is the height (in pixels).  When a shading rate image or fragment density
    map is not used, both components will be one.  When using a shading
    rate image or fragment density map, either or both components may be
    greater than one.  When a fragment larger than one pixel is processed by a
    single fragment shader invocation, the outputs of the shader invocation
    will be broadcast to all covered pixels/samples in the fragment.  When a
    fragment larger than one pixel is processed by multiple fragment shader
    invocations, the outputs of each shader invocation will be a broadcast to
    an implementation-dependent subset of the covered pixels/samples in the
    fragment.

    The input variable gl_FragInvocationCountEXT represents the maximum number
    of fragment shader invocations executed for each fragment, as derived from
    the effective invocation density for the fragment. The actual number of
    fragment shader invocations for a given fragment may be less than this
    maximum invocation count. For example, if a primitive does not fully
    cover the fragment, invocations may not be generated for uncovered
    portions of the fragment. When a shading rate image or fragment density
    map is not used, this value will be no greater than the framebuffer
    sample counts and may be affected by the sample shading fraction
    programmed in the OpenGL API via MinSampleShading or the Vulkan API via
    minSampleShading. When using a shading rate image or fragment density map,
    this value will also be affected by the contents of the texture and may
    depend on the location of the pixel in the framebuffer. If multisampling
    is disabled, the value of this input will be one.

    Modify Section 8.13.1, Derivative Functions, p. 184

    (add a new paragraph before the last paragraph "It is typical to consider
    a 2x2 square", p. 184)

    When using an fragment invocation density where each fragment covers
    multiple columns and/or rows of pixels, the values of dx and/or dy
    in equations 1b and 2b above will be greater than 1.0.  However,
    we recommend that implementations approximate derivatives in this case
    using dx = dy = 1.0.

Dependencies on OpenGL ES 3.2 and OES_sample_shading

    If neither OpenGL ES 3.2 nor OES_sample_shading are supported, ignore
    all references to per-sample shading and the MinSampleShading API
    command.

Issues

    (1) How should we name this extension and the builtins?

      RESOLVED:  We are calling this extension
      "EXT_fragment_invocation_density", because we are adding two
      new built-ins which allow an application to determine the
      "fragment invocation density".

      For the built-in indicating the size of the fragment, we chose to use
      "gl_FragSizeEXT". We considered using the terms Size and Area for the
      builtin. Both had merits, and Size would have matched with
      gl_FragmentSizeNV from the original extension, but Size doesn't really
      match the API extension's terminology. Area has the advantage that it
      matches the Vulkan glossary name. One drawback of Area might be that
      it tends imply a scalar value that would be the width x height of a
      fragment. In the end, Size won out.  We also chose to use the "Frag"
      prefix instead of "Fragment" as there are a number of GLSL built-ins
      that use "Frag" as a prefix (gl_FragCoord, gl_FragDepth, gl_FragColor,
      gl_FragData) and none that use "Fragment".

      We also decided to pick a new name for InvocationsPerPixelNV as
      a fragment may actually represent more than a single pixel in cases
      where the shading rate image or fragment density maps results in
      coarse shading. We settled on the name gl_FragInvocationCountEXT
      to indicate how many invocations are being executed per fragment.

    (2) How do derivatives work for dFdx and texture LOD calculations when a
        single fragment shader invocation covers multiple pixels?

      RESOLVED:  In the NVIDIA implementation of this extension, derivatives
      will be computed by differencing, where the "neighboring" fragment
      shader invocation also covers the same number of pixels.  Differencing
      can be used to approximate derivatives at a given (x,y) by evaluating
      equations like the following:

        df/dx(x,y) = (f(x2,y) - f(x1,y)) / (x2 - x1)

      where <x1> and <x2> are X coordinates of for the two fragment shader
      invocations used for differencing.  <x> is typically either <x1> or
      <x2>.  For normal fragment shader invocations, where each fragment
      typically covers a pixel, we assume that x2-x1 is always 1.0 and reduce
      the approximation to:

        df/dx(x,y) = f(x2,y) - f(x1,y)

      We end up using this equation in this extension, even when fragments
      cover multiple pixels and x2-x1 is greater than 1.0.  If a given
      fragment shader invocation covers a 2x2 region, this approach means that
      dFdx and dFdy will return values approximately twice as large as
      the real derivatives.

      We could adjust computed derivatives to compensate, but choose not to
      because using raw differences without adjustment is preferable for
      texture LOD handling.  Derivatives in LOD calculations are used to
      approximate the set of texels covered by the pixel being processed.  If
      that pixel covers many texels in a full-resolution image, we use a
      lower-resolution mipmap level to reduce noise.  When a fragment shader
      invocation covers multiple pixels, its footprint in texture space is
      larger than it would be if it covered a single pixel.  In this case, our
      "mathematically too large" derivatives provide a better approximation of
      the set of texels involved in the lookup.

      If a shader using this feature does need mathematically accurate
      derivatives, it can adjust by dividing through by the X and Y
      components of gl_FragSizeEXT.

    (3) How is this extension different from GL_NV_shading_rate_image?

      RESOLVED: In this extension we use the term gl_FragSizeEXT instead
      of gl_FragmentSizeNV and gl_FragInvocationCountEXT instead of
      gl_InvocationsPerPixelNV, but these are otherwise functionally
      equivalent. This shading language extension is not tightly coupled
      with any specific API extension and can be used with
      GL_NV_shading_rate_image in OpenGL and with VK_NV_shading_rate_image
      or VK_EXT_fragment_density_map in Vulkan but it doesn't require
      any of them as it provides useful functionality on it's own.

      This extension also doesn't include interactions with
      ARB_fragment_shader_interlock.
