Dependencies

    Written against SPIR-V 1.6.
    Written against GLSL 4.60.8.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 1.40
    (#version 140) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.10
    (#version 310) and higher.

Overview

    This extension allows composite constructors to result in
    specialization constants.

Add to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification

    Including the following line in a shader will control the language
    features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_EXT_spec_constant_composites : <behavior>

    Where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    This new definition is added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

      #define GL_EXT_spec_constant_composites 1

Changes to Chapter 5 "Operators and Expressions" to the OpenGL Shading Language
Specification:

    In section 5.12, "Specialization-Constant Operations", add "composite
    constructors" to the list of operations that can result in spec constants.
