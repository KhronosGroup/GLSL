Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.50
    (#version 450) and higher.

    This extension interacts with GL_NV_cooperative_vector.

Overview

    This extension adds a templated "vector<ComponentType, NumElements>"
    type where the number of elements is not limited to four and can either
    be a literal or a constant expression.

Mapping to SPIR-V
-----------------

    For informational purposes (non-normative), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs:

        vector<T, literal> -> OpTypeVector
        vector<T, constant expression> -> OpTypeVectorIdEXT

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

        #extension GL_EXT_long_vector : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

        #define GL_EXT_long_vector 1

Modify Section 3.6, Keywords
(add to list of keywords)

    vector

Modify Section 4.1.5, Vectors

    Add to the end of the section:

    Vectors with arbitrary length, or length determined by a constant
    expression, can be declared using 'vector<T, N>'.

    Vectors are parameterized by two type parameters: type per component,
    and number of components. The parameters are specified in order between angle
    brackets ('<' and '>') and are comma-separated. The number of
    components can be a constant expression or specialization constant
    expression, and no error checking is performed on the value at
    compile time. The type per component must be a scalar numerical or boolean type.

    Vector types with more than four components can be used as global
    variables, local variables, function parameters, function return values,
    and in uniform, buffer, shared memory, push constant, or shaderrecord storage.

    If GL_NV_cooperative_vector is supported, coopvecNV and vector types
    with matching parameters are constructable from each other.

Modify Section 5.5, Vector and Scalar Components and Length

    Add to the end of the section:

    Component selection using the period (.) operator is not allowed for
    vector types declared using the `vector` keyword. Array subscripting
    syntax is allowed.

Modify Chapter 8. Built-In Functions

    Modify the gen*Type placeholders to allow vector<T, N> for any value of N,
    and for the appropriate component type T.

Modify Section 8.7. Vector Relational Functions

    Modify the *vec placeholders to allow vector<T, N> for any value of N,
    and for the appropriate component type T.

Modify Section 9, Shading Language Grammar for Core Profile
(Add to tokens list)

    VECTOR

Modifications to the OpenGL Specification, Version 4.6

Modify 7.6.2.2 Standard Uniform Block Layout

    Modify rule 3:

    3. If the member is a vector with three or more components, with components
    consuming N basic machine units, the base alignment is 4N.

Issues

    (1) Is there an upper limit on N?

    RESOLVED: The API will define a limit, GLSL will not define a limit.
