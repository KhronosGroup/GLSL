Depenendencies

  This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 1.40
  (#version 140) and higher.

  This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.10
  (#version 310) and higher.

  This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
  Specification, version 4.60 (revision 7), dated July 10, 2019

  This extension requires GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl.

Overview

  This extension adds a new type of jump to the language, terminateInvocation. Similarly
  to discard, terminateInvocation also discards fragment from being processed.
  TerminateInvocation allows a programmer to disambiguate the underlying
  behavior they wish to express for discard. It is recommended that programmers
  use demote (see GL_EXT_demote_to_helper_invocation) or terminateInvocation
  instead of discard.

New Procedures and Functions

  None.

New Tokens

  None.

Modifications to GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl

  Add to the "Mapping to SPIR-V" section

  Mapping terminateInvocation:

    terminateInvocation should be generated as OpTerminateInvocation.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

  Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the language
  features described in this extension:

    #extension GL_EXT_terminate_invocation : <behavior>

  where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

  New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

    #define GL_EXT_terminate_invocation    1

  In section 3.6 Keywords:

  Add "terminateInvocation" to the list of keywords.

  In chapter 6 Statements and Structures:

  Add terminateInvocation to the list of jumps.

  In section 6.4 Jumps:

  Add the following to the grammar of jump_statement:

    terminateInvocation; // in the fragment shader language only

  Replace the paragraph:

    The discard keyword is only allowed within fragment shaders. It can be used
    within a fragment shader to abandon the operation on the current fragment.
    This keyword causes the fragment to be discarded and no updates to any
    buffers will occur. Any prior writes to other buffers such as shader
    storage buffers are unaffected. Control flow exits the shader, and
    subsequent implicit or explicit derivatives are undefined when this control
    flow is non-uniform (meaning different fragments within the primitive take
    different control paths). It would typically be used within a conditional
    statement, for example:

  Replace the paragraph:

    The function main can use return. This simply causes main to exit in the
    same way as when the end of the function had been reached. It does not
    imply a use of discard in a fragment shader. Using return in main before
    defining outputs will have the same behavior as reaching the end of main
    before defining outputs.

  In section 7.1.5 Fragment Shader Special Variables:

  Replace the paragraph:

    If a shader executes the discard keyword, the fragment is discarded, and
    the values of any user-defined fragment outputs, gl_FragDepth, and
    gl_SampleMask become irrelevant.

  With:

    If a shader executes the discard or terminateInvocation keyword, the fragment is
    discarded, and the values of any user-defined fragment outputs,
    gl_FragDepth, and gl_SampleMask become irrelevant.
  
  In section 7.1.7 Compatibility Profile Built-In Language Variables:

  Replace the paragraph:

    If a shader executes the discard keyword, the fragment is discarded, and
    the values of gl_FragDepth and gl_FragColor become irrelevant.

  With:

    If a shader executes the discard or terminateInvocation keyword, the fragment is
    discarded, and the values of gl_FragDepth and gl_FragColor become
    irrelevant.

  In chapter 9 Shading Language Grammar:

  Add TERMINATE_INVOCATION to the list of tokens.

  Add the following line to the grammar of jump_statement:

    TERMINATE_INVOCATION SEMICOLON // Fragment shader only.

Errors

  None.
