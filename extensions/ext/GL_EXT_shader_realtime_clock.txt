    OpenGL Extension #

Dependencies

    This extension is written against Revision 8 of the version 4.40 of the
    OpenGL Shading Language Specification, dated June 16, 2014.

    This extension builds upon features introduced by the
    GL_ARB_shader_clock extension.

    This extension interacts with GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64.

    This extension requires OpenGL 4.4 or OpenGL ES 3.1.

Overview

    This extension exposes a real-time counter which may be used
    to derive timing information within a shader.

    Mapping to SPIR-V
    -----------------

    For informational purposes (non-specification), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs:

        clockRealtime2x32EXT -> OpReadClockKHR with a Scope of Device, Result type of uvec2
        clockRealtimeEXT -> OpReadClockKHR with a Scope of Device, Result type of uint64_t

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    None.

IP Status

    None.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.50

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_EXT_shader_realtime_clock : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

      #define GL_EXT_shader_realtime_clock     1

Additions to Chapter 8 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Built-in Functions)

    Add New Section 8.18, "Timing Functions"

    Syntax:

        uvec2    clockRealtime2x32EXT(void);
        uint64_t clockRealtimeEXT(void);

    The clockRealtimeEXT() function returns a 64-bit value representing a
    real-time clock that is globally coherent by all invocations on the GPU.
    clockRealtime2x32EXT() returns the same value encoded as a two-component
    vector of 32-bit unsigned integers with the first component containing
    the 32 least significant bits and the second component containing the 
    32 most significant bits.

    The units of time are not defined for either of these operations and will
    wrap after exceeding the maximum value representable in 64 bits. These
    functions serve as code motion barriers.

Dependencies on GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64:

    This extension depends on GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 for 64-bit integer values.
    If GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 is not supported, remove clockRealtimeEXT() and any
    reference to the uint64 type.

IP Status

    None.

Issues

1. What is the difference between EXT_shader_realtime_clock and ARB_shader_clock ?
    
    RESOLUTION: The main difference between these extensions is locality,
    EXT_shader_realtime_clock is a clock value that is coherent across all invocations
    of the GPU, while ARB_shader_clock times are local to single workgroup.
