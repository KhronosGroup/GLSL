Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.60
    (#version 460) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.20
    (#version 320) and higher.
    
    This extension is written against revision 7 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.60, dated July 10, 2019.

    This extension is written against revision 6 of the OpenGL ES ESSL
    version 3.20, dated July 10, 2019.

    This extension interacts with revision 43 of the GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl
    extension, dated October 25, 2017.

Overview

    This extension allows a subpass shading shader to delcare subpass inputs and use subpass input functions.    
    
Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_HUAWEI_subpass_shading                          : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    New preprocessor #defines are added:

      #define GL_HUAWEI_subpass_shading  

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Add Section 2.7. Subpass Shading Processor
    
    The subpass shading processor is a programmable unit that operates the subpass inputs. It runs independently 
    from the other shader processors. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this
    processor are called subpass shading shaders. When a set of subpass shading shaders are successfully compiled 
    and linked, they result in a subpass shading shader executable that runs on the subpass shading processor.

    A subpass shading shader is almost identical to a compute shader except the following
    differences.
        
        * A subpass shading shader must be dispatched in a dedicate subpass
        * A subpass shading shader is allowed to read fragment from input attachment
        * The work dimension is defined by the size of render area and the number of layers of the framebuffer
        
Changes to Chapter 4 of The OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Modify Section 4.1.7, (Opaque Types)

    Change the "Subpass-input types are only available in fragment shaders." to 

    Subpass-input types are only available in fragment or subpass shading shaders.

Changes to Chapter 8 of The OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Modify Section 8.18, (Subpass-Input Functions)

    Change the "Subpass-input functions are only available when targeting a Vulkan fragment stage." to 

    Subpass-input functions are only available when targeting a Vulkan fragment or subpass shading stage.

Changes to Chapter 12 of The OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Modify Section 12.2.4, (Vulkan Only: Samplers, Images, Textures, and Buffers)

    Change the "Subpass inputs are read through a new set of types, available only to fragment shaders:" to 

    Subpass inputs are read through a new set of types, available only to fragment or subpass shading shaders:
