Overview

	This extension allowing application to use a new programmable shader type -- Cluster Culling Shader -- 
	to execute geometry culling on GPU. This mechanism does not require pipeline barrier between compute shader 
	and other rendering pipeline.

	This new shader types have execution environments similar to that of compute shaders, where a collection of 
	shader invocations form a workgroup and cooperate to perfrom coarse level culling and emit one or more 
	drawing command to the subsequent rendering pipeline to draw visible clusters.


Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60.7
	
	Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the language features described in this extension:
			#extension GL_HUAWEI_cluster_culling_shader		 : <behavior>
	where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.	
	A new preprocessor #define is added to the OpenGL Shading Language:	
			#define GL_HUAWEI_cluster_culling_shader


	Modify the introduction to Chapter 2, Overview of OpenGL Shading (p.6)
    
	(modify first paragraph)  ... Currently, these processors are the vertex,
    	tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, fragment,
    	compute, and cluster culling processors.

    	(modify second paragraph)  ... The specific languages will be referred to
    	by the name of the processor they target: vertex, tessellation control,
    	tessellation evaluation, geometry, fragment, compute, or cluster culling.

	Insert new sections at the end of Chapter 2 (p.8)

	Section 2.7, Cluster Culling Processor

	Cluster Culling Shader(CCS) is similar to the existing compute shader; its main purpose is to provide an
 	execution environment in order to perform coarse-level geometry culling and level-of-detail selection more 
	efficiently on GPU.

	The traditional 2-pass GPU culling solution using compute shader needs a pipeline barrier between compute 
	pipeline and graphics pipeline, sometimes, in order to optimize performance, an additional compaction 
	process may also be required. this extension improve the above mention shortcomings which can allow compute 
	shader directly emit visible clusters to following graphics pipeline.

	A set of new built-in output variables are used to express visible cluster, in addition, a new built-in 
	function is used to emit these variables from CCS to subsequent rendering pipeline, then IA can use these 
	variables to fetches vertices of visible cluster and drive vertex shader to shading these vertices. 
	As stated above, both IA and vertex shader are perserved, vertex shader still used for vertices position 
	shading, instead of directly outputting a set of transformed vertices from compute shader, this makes CCS 
	more suitable for mobile GPUs.


	Modify Section 4.3.4, Input Variables (p. 50)
	(add below sentence after the last paragraph, p53)

	All built-in input variables of Cluster Culling Shader are the same as Compute Shader, no other new ones are added.

	
	Modify Section 4.3.6, Output Variables(p.54)
	(modify last paragraph to add cluster culling shaders, p.54)
	
	It is a compile-time error to declare a vertex, tessellation evaluation,
	tessellation control, geometry or cluster culling shader output that contains any of the following:  ...


	Modify Section 4.3.8, Shared Variables(p.57)
	(modify first paragraph of the section, p57)
	The shared qualifier is used to declare variables that have storage shared between all work items in a compute, 	
	cluster culling shader local work group. Variables declared as shared may only be used in compute, cluster culling 
	shaders.  ...

	
	Modify Section 4.4, Layout Qualifiers, p. 62
    	(modify the layout qualifier table, pp. 63-66)

	Layout Qualifier   | Qualifier | Individual | Block | Block  | Allowed interfaces
                           | only      | variabl    |       | Member |
      	-------------------+-----------+------------+-------+--------+--------------------
      local_size_x =       |           |            |       |        | compute in
      local_size_y =       |     X     |            |       |        | cluster culling in
      local_size_z =       |           |            |       |        | 
      ---------------------+-----------+------------+-------+--------+--------------------



	Modify Section in 4.4.1, Cluster Culling Shader Inputs, p.66
	(add below sentence after the last paragraph, p76)
	(note:  the content of this section is nearly identical to the content of section 4.4.1, Compute Shader Inputs)
	There are no layout location qualifiers for cluster culling shader inputs. Layout qualifier identifiers for cluster 
	culling shader inputs are the work group size qualifiers:

  	layout-qualifier-id :
    	local_size_x = integer-constant-expression
   	local_size_y = integer-constant-expression
    	local_size_z = integer-constant-expression

	These cluster culling shader input layout qualifers behave identically to the
	equivalent compute shader qualifiers and specify a fixed local group size
	used for each cluster culling shader work group. If no size is specified in any of
	the three dimensions, a default size of one will be used.

	Modify Section 7.1, Built-In Language Variables (p.138)
	(add 7.1.7 Cluster Culling Shader Special Variable , p.148)
	(modify 7.1.7. Compatibility Profile Built-In Language Variables to 7.1.8. Compatibility Profile Built-In Language Variables, p.148)
	
	In the cluster culling language, built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:

	const uvec3 gl_WorkGroupSize;
	in uvec3 gl_WorkGroupID;
      	in uvec3 gl_LocalInvocationID;
      	in uvec3 gl_GlobalInvocationID;
      	in uint  gl_LocalInvocationIndex;

	// type 1 (non-indexed mode)
	out gl_PerClusterHUAWEI
	{
    	  uint gl_VertexCountHUAWEI;
    	  uint gl_InstanceCountHUAWEI;
    	  uint gl_FirstVertexHUAWEI;
    	  uint gl_FirstInstanceHUAWEI;
	  uint gl_ClusterIDHUAWEI;
    	}
	// type 2 (indexed mode)
	out gl_PerClusterHUAWEI
	{
    	  uint gl_IndexCountHUAWEI;
    	  uint gl_InstanceCountHUAWEI;
    	  uint gl_FirstIndexHUAWEI ;
    	  int  gl_VertexOffsetHUAWEI;
    	  uint gl_FirstInstanceHUAWEI;
    	  uint gl_ClusterIDHUAWEI;
	}


	Cluster culling shader input variables
	gl_WorkGroupSize, gl_WorkGroupID, gl_LocalInvocationID, gl_GlobalInvocationID, gl_LocalInvocationIndex are used
	in the same fashion as the corresponding input variables in the computer shader.


	Cluster culling shader output variables   
	cluster culling shader have the following built-in output variables.

	gl_IndexCountHUAWEI is the number of vertices to draw in indexed mode.
	gl_VertexCountHUAWEI is the number of vertices to draw.
	gl_InstanceCountHUAWEI is the number of instances to draw.
	gl_FirstIndexHUAWEI is the base index within the index buffer.
	gl_FirstVertexHUAWEI is the index of the first vertex to draw.
	gl_VertexOffsetHUAWEI is the value added to the vertex index before indexing into the vertex buffer.
	gl_FirstInstanceHUAWEI is the instance ID of the first instance to draw.
	gl_ClusterIDHUAWEI is the index of cluster being rendered by this drawing command.


	(modify the discussion of the built-in variables shared with compute shaders, which starts on p. 147)
	The built-in constant gl_WorkGroupSize is a compute, clust culling shader
    	constant containing the local work-group size of the shader. The size ...

    	The built-in variable gl_WorkGroupID is a compute, cluster culling shader
    	input variable containing the three-dimensional index of the global work
    	group that the current invocation is executing in. ...

   	 The built-in variable gl_LocalInvocationID is a compute, cluster culling
    	shader input variable containing the three-dimensional index of the local
    	work group within the global work group that the current invocation is
    	executing in. ...

    	The built-in variable gl_GlobalInvocationID is a compute, cluster culling
    	shader input variable containing the global index of the current work
    	item. This value uniquely identifies this invocation from all other
    	invocations across all local and global work groups initiated by the
    	current DispatchCompute or DispatchMeshTasksNV call or by a previously
    	executed task shader. ...

    	The built-in variable gl_LocalInvocationIndex is a compute, cluster culling
    	hader input variable that contains the one-dimensional representation of
    	the gl_LocalInvocationID.


	Modify Section 8.16, Shader Invocation Control Functions, p. 201
    	(modify first paragraph of the section, p. 201)
    	The shader invocation control function is available only in tessellation
    	control, compute, and cluster culling shaders.  It is used
    	to control the relative execution order of multiple shader invocations
    	used to process a patch (in the case of tessellation control shaders) or a
    	local work group (in the case of compute, cluster culling shaders), which
    	are otherwise executed with an undefined relative order.
	
    	(modify the last paragraph, p. 201)
    	For compute, cluster culling shaders, the barrier() function may be placed
    	within flow control, but that flow control must be uniform flow control.

	Modify Section 8.17, Shader Memory Control Functions, p. 201

    	(modify table of functions, p. 202)

      	void memoryBarrierShared()

        Control the ordering of memory transactions to shared variables issued
        within a single shader invocation.

        Only available in compute, cluster culling shaders.

      	
	void groupMemoryBarrier()

        Control the ordering of all memory transactions issued within a single
        shader invocation, as viewed by other invocations in the same work
        group.

        Only available in compute, cluster culling shaders.

    	
	(modify last paragraph, p. 202)

    	... all of the above variable types. The functions memoryBarrierShared()
    	and groupMemoryBarrier() are available only in compute, cluster culling
    	shaders; the other functions are available in all shader types.

    	
	(modify last paragraph, p. 203)

    	... When using the function groupMemoryBarrier(), this ordering guarantee
    	applies only to other shader invocations in the same compute, cluster culling shader work group; all other memory barrier
	functions provide the guarantee to all other shader invocations. ...
