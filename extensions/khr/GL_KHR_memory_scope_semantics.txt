Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.20
    (#version 420) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.10
    (#version 310) and higher.

    This extension is written against revision 3 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.60, dated July 23, 2017.

    This extension interacts with GL_KHR_shader_atomic_int64.

Overview

    This extension document modifies GLSL to add scopes and memory semantics
    for atomic operations and barriers. For atomics, these are added as
    optional parameters to the existing atomic built-in functions. For
    barriers, two new builtin functions are added that correspond to SPIR-V's
    OpMemoryBarrier and OpControlBarrier.

    The meanings of scopes and semantics are defined in detail in the Vulkan
    Memory Model section of the Vulkan specification, and those definitions are
    not reproduced here. But in short:
    
      * "Scope" can be used to limit the set of invocations that an atomic
        operation is atomic respect to, and to limit the set of invocations
        that a barrier synchronizes with. On some implementations, a smaller
        scope may be more efficient.
      * "Storage class semantics" can be used to limit the set of memory
        storage classes that are synchronized by a release or acquire
        operation. On some implementations, synchronizing fewer storage
        classes may be more efficient (e.g. synchronizing shared memory
        is often cheaper than buffer or image memory).
      * "Release/Acquire semantics" are used to guarantee ordering between
        an atomic or barrier and other memory operations that occur before
        or after it in program order, as observed by other invocations.

    Mapping to SPIR-V
    -----------------

    For informational purposes (non-specification), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs:

        gl_Scope* values are equal to the corresponding SPIR-V Scope enums
        and can simply be passed through

        gl_StorageSemantics* and gl_Semantics* values should be bitwise
        ORed together to generate the SPIR-V Semantics enums

        atomicLoad      -> OpAtomicLoad
        atomicStore     -> OpAtomicStore
        controlBarrier  -> OpControlBarrier
        memoryBarrier   -> OpMemoryBarrier

        coherent                -> equivalent to queuefamilycoherent
        devicecoherent          -> NonPrivate{Pointer,Texel}KHR + Make{Pointer,Texel}{Available,Visible}KHR with scope = Device
        queuefamilycoherent     -> NonPrivate{Pointer,Texel}KHR + Make{Pointer,Texel}{Available,Visible}KHR with scope = QueueFamilyKHR
        workgroupcoherent       -> NonPrivate{Pointer,Texel}KHR + Make{Pointer,Texel}{Available,Visible}KHR with scope = Workgroup
        subgroupcoherent        -> NonPrivate{Pointer,Texel}KHR + Make{Pointer,Texel}{Available,Visible}KHR with scope = Subgroup
        nonprivate              -> NonPrivate{Pointer,Texel}KHR
        volatile                -> Volatile (for buffers) or VolatileTexelKHR (for image access)

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.50

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_KHR_memory_scope_semantics           : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    A new preprocessor #define is added:

      #define GL_KHR_memory_scope_semantics                1


Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Variables and Types)

    Modify Section 4.3.8, Shared Variables

    Replace "Shared variables are implicitly coherent" with
    "Shared variables are implicitly workgroupcoherent".

    Modify Section 4.10, Memory Qualifiers

    (Add new rows to the table, and update the row for "coherent")

        coherent: alias of queuefamilycoherent

        devicecoherent: memory variable where writes have automatic
                  availability operations and reads have automatic visibility
                  operations to the shader domain

        queuefamilycoherent: memory variable where writes have automatic
                  availability operations and reads have automatic visibility
                  operations to the queue family instance domain

        workgroupcoherent: memory variable where writes have automatic
                  availability operations and reads have automatic visibility
                  operations to the workgroup instance domain

        subgroupcoherent: memory variable where writes have automatic
                  availability operations and reads have automatic visibility
                  operations to the subgroup instance domain

        nonprivate: memory variable that is not coherent, but still obeys
                  inter-invocation ordering requirements

    (Replace the two paragraphs about "coherent")

    Memory accesses to image variables declared using the devicecoherent
    qualifier have implicit availability or visibility operations which allow
    them to be used to share data with other shader invocations. In
    particular, when reading a variable declared as devicecoherent, the
    values returned will reflect the results of previously completed writes
    performed by other shader invocations. When writing a variable declared
    as devicecoherent, the values written will be reflected in subsequent
    devicecoherent reads performed by other shader invocations.

    Similarly, variables declared using the queuefamilycoherent qualifier
    have implicit availability or visibility operations which allow them to
    be used to share data with other shader invocations in the same
    queue family. However, relative to accesses via invocations in other
    queue families, such variables behave the same as unqualified (non-coherent)
    variables.

    Similarly, variables declared using the workgroupcoherent qualifier
    have implicit availability or visibility operations which allow them to
    be used to share data with other shader invocations in the same
    workgroup. However, relative to accesses via invocations in other
    workgroups, such variables behave the same as unqualified (non-coherent)
    variables.

    Similarly, variables declared using the subgroupcoherent qualifier
    have implicit availability or visibility operations which allow them to
    be used to share data with other shader invocations in the same
    subgroup. However, relative to accesses via invocations in other
    subgroups, such variables behave the same as unqualified (non-coherent)
    variables.

    It is a compile-time error to decorate a variable with more than one of
    devicecoherent, queuefamilycoherent, workgroupcoherent, and
    subgroupcoherent.

    As described in section 7.11 "Shader Memory Access" of
    the OpenGL Specification, shader memory reads and writes complete in a
    largely undefined order. The built-in function memoryBarrier() can be used
    if needed to guarantee the completion and relative ordering of memory
    accesses performed by a single shader invocation.

    When accessing memory using variables not declared as devicecoherent,
    queuefamilycoherent, workgroupcoherent, or subgroupcoherent, the
    memory accessed by a shader may be cached by the implementation to service
    future accesses to the same address. Memory stores may be cached in such a
    way that the values written might not be visible to other shader
    invocations accessing the same memory. The implementation may cache the
    values fetched by memory reads and return the same values to any shader
    invocation accessing the same memory, even if the underlying memory has
    been modified since the first memory read. While variables not declared as
    coherent might not be useful for communicating between shader invocations,
    using non-coherent accesses may result in higher performance.

    Variables declared using the nonprivate qualifier obey the ordering
    requirements defined by barriers and atomics. devicecoherent,
    queuefamilycoherent, workgroupcoherent, and subgroupcoherent
    variables are all implicitly nonprivate. Accesses to noncoherent private
    variables can be reordered across barriers and atomics. nonprivate
    noncoherent variables are primarily useful to avoid write-after-read
    hazards, where a non-private read must occur before a barrier.

    ...

    The memory qualifiers subgroupcoherent, workgroupcoherent,
    queuefamilycoherent, devicecoherent, volatile, restrict, readonly,
    writeonly, and nonprivate may be used in the declaration of buffer
    variables (i.e., members of shader storage blocks). ...

    ...

    Variables qualified with subgroupcoherent, workgroupcoherent,
    queuefamilycoherent, devicecoherent, volatile, readonly, writeonly,
    or nonprivate may not be passed to functions whose formal parameters
    lack such qualifiers. ...

    (Add to the end of the section)

    Sampler variables and uniform blocks and block members can be decorated
    with nonprivate, which causes them to obey inter-thread ordering
    requirements. It is a compile-time error to use any other memory
    qualifiers on sampler variables or uniform blocks or block members.


Additions to Chapter 8 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Built-in Functions)

    Modify Section 8.11, Atomic Memory Functions

    (Add devicecoherent, queuefamilycoherent, workgroupcoherent,

                                 int storageUnequal, int semUnequal)

    (Add new built-in functions)

        // Atomically loads the value from <mem> and returns it
            uint atomicLoad (in     uint mem, int scope, int storage, int sem)
             int atomicLoad (in      int mem, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint64_t atomicLoad (in uint64_t mem, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int64_t atomicLoad (in  int64_t mem, int scope, int storage, int sem)

        // Atomically stores the value of <data> to <mem>
        void atomicStore (out     uint mem,     uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        void atomicStore (out      int mem,      int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        void atomicStore (out uint64_t mem, uint64_t data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        void atomicStore (out  int64_t mem,  int64_t data, int scope, int storage, int sem)

    The values passed as scope, storage, and sem parameters must all be
    integer constant expressions. Valid values are listed in the Scope and
    Semantics section. scope must be a gl_Scope* value, sem* must be a
    gl_Semantics* value, and storage* must be a combination of
    gl_StorageSemantics* values.

    (Add a new subsection to the end of this section)

        Scope and Semantics

        gl_Scope*, gl_Semantics*, and gl_StorageSemantics* are constant integer
        values which can be used for the scope, storage, and sem parameters to
        atomic built-in functions. For scope and semantics, only the listed
        values are valid. For storage semantics, any bitwise combination of the
        listed values is valid.

            const int gl_ScopeDevice      = 1;
            const int gl_ScopeWorkgroup   = 2;
            const int gl_ScopeSubgroup    = 3;
            const int gl_ScopeInvocation  = 4;
            const int gl_ScopeQueueFamily = 5;

            const int gl_SemanticsRelaxed         = 0x0;
            const int gl_SemanticsAcquire         = 0x2;
            const int gl_SemanticsRelease         = 0x4;
            const int gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease  = 0x8;
            const int gl_SemanticsMakeAvailable   = 0x2000;
            const int gl_SemanticsMakeVisible     = 0x4000;

            const int gl_StorageSemanticsNone     = 0x0;
            const int gl_StorageSemanticsBuffer   = 0x40;
            const int gl_StorageSemanticsShared   = 0x100;
            const int gl_StorageSemanticsImage    = 0x800;
            const int gl_StorageSemanticsOutput   = 0x1000;

        The meaning of these values is defined in the Vulkan Memory Model.

        The following error checks are applied to commands that accept these
        values. Each results in a compile-time error.

         * gl_SemanticsAcquire must not be used with atomicStore or
           imageAtomicStore.

         * gl_SemanticsRelease must not be used with atomicLoad or
           imageAtomicLoad.

         * gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease must not be used with atomicLoad,
           imageAtomicLoad, atomicStore, or imageAtomicStore.

         * Semantics operands must only have gl_Semantics* bits set.

         * Storage class semantics operands must only have
           gl_StorageSemantics* bits set.

         * Semantics must not include multiple of gl_SemanticsRelease,
           gl_SemanticsAcquire, or gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease.

         * memoryBarrier must use exactly one of gl_SemanticsRelease,
           gl_SemanticsAcquire, or gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease.

         * memoryBarrier must not use storage class semantics of zero.

         * If controlBarrier uses non-zero semantics, then it must not use
           storage class semantics of zero.

         * atomicCompSwap and imageAtomicCompSwap semUnequal must not use
           gl_SemanticsRelease or gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease.

         * If semantics includes gl_SemanticsMakeAvailable it must also
           include gl_SemanticsRelease or gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease.

         * If semantics includes gl_SemanticsMakeVisible it must also
           include gl_SemanticsAcquire or gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease.

    Modify Section 8.12, Image Functions

    (Add devicecoherent, queuefamilycoherent, workgroupcoherent,
    subgroupcoherent, nonprivate)

    All the built-in functions in this section accept arguments with
    combinations of restrict, subgroupcoherent, workgroupcoherent,
    queuefamilycoherent, devicecoherent, volatile, and nonprivate
    memory qualification, despite not having them listed in the prototypes.

    (Add new variants of atomic built-in functions with additional
     scope/semantics parameters)

        uint imageAtomicAdd (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicAdd (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint imageAtomicMin (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicMin (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint imageAtomicMax (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicMax (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint imageAtomicAnd (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicAnd (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint imageAtomicOr  (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicOr  (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint imageAtomicXor (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicXor (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint imageAtomicExchange (IMAGE_PARAMS,  uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicExchange (IMAGE_PARAMS,   int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
       float imageAtomicExchange (IMAGE_PARAMS, float data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        uint imageAtomicCompSwap (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint compare, uint data, int scope,
                                  int   storageEqual, int   semEqual,
                                  int storageUnequal, int semUnequal)
         int imageAtomicCompSwap (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int compare,  int data, int scope,
                                  int   storageEqual, int   semEqual,
                                  int storageUnequal, int semUnequal)

    (Add new built-in functions)

        // Atomically loads the value from the image and returns it
        uint imageAtomicLoad (IMAGE_PARAMS, int scope, int storage, int sem)
         int imageAtomicLoad (IMAGE_PARAMS, int scope, int storage, int sem)

        // Atomically stores the value of <data> to the image
        void imageAtomicStore (IMAGE_PARAMS, uint data, int scope, int storage, int sem)
        void imageAtomicStore (IMAGE_PARAMS,  int data, int scope, int storage, int sem)

    The values passed as scope, storage, and sem parameters must all be
    integer constant expressions. Valid values are listed in the Scope and
    Semantics section. scope must be a gl_Scope* value, sem* must be a
    gl_Semantics* value, and storage* must be a combination of
    gl_StorageSemantics* values.

    Modify Section 8.16, Shader Invocation Control Functions

    (Replace the table and the second paragraph with the following)

    The following built-in function performs a control barrier as defined in
    the Vulkan Memory Model:

        void controlBarrier(int execution, int memory, int storage, int sem);

    Informally, a control barrier can be used in conjunction with memory
    barriers (including those memory barriers optionally performed by
    controlBarrier itself) to synchronize memory accesses between shader
    invocations.

    The values passed as execution, memory, storage, and sem parameters must
    all be integer constant expressions. Valid values are listed in the Scope
    and Semantics section. execution and memory must be gl_Scope* values, sem*
    must be a gl_Semantics* value, and storage* must be a combination of
    gl_StorageSemantics* values.

    The built-in function "void barrier()" in tessellation control shaders can
    be used to control-barrier-order accesses to output variables. Informally,
    this means it synchronizes accesses to those variables before the barrier
    against those after the barrier.

    In compute shaders, barrier() is equivalent to controlBarrier() with
    execution and memory scope equal to gl_ScopeWorkgroup, storage semantics
    equal to gl_StorageSemanticsShared, and sem equal to
    gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease. Informally, this means it synchronizes
    accesses to shared memory between invocations in the same workgroup.


    Replace Section 8.17, Shader Memory Control Functions

    Shaders of all types can read and write the contents of textures and
    buffer objects using image and buffer variables. The relative order of
    reads and writes from multiple shader invocations is largely undefined.
    Memory barrier functions can be used to synchronize memory accesses
    between invocations as described in the Vulkan Memory Model.

    The following built-in function is a memory barrier as defined in the
    Vulkan Memory Model:

        void memoryBarrier(int memory, int storage, int sem);

    The above function is a general memory barrier that can synchronize with
    any supported scope or semantics. Legacy built-in functions that
    synchronize a subset of memory or with particular scopes are also
    supported:

    The values passed as memory, storage, and sem parameters must all be
    integer constant expressions. Valid values are listed in the Scope and
    Semantics section. memory must be a gl_Scope* value, sem* must be a
    gl_Semantics* value, and storage* must be a combination of
    gl_StorageSemantics* values.

        void memoryBarrier()
        // equivalent to:
        // memoryBarrier(gl_ScopeQueueFamily,
        //               gl_StorageSemanticsBuffer |
        //               gl_StorageSemanticsShared |
        //               gl_StorageSemanticsImage,
        //               gl_SemanticsAcquireRelease)

Interactions with GL_KHR_shader_atomic_int64

    If GL_KHR_shader_atomic_int64 is not supported, the atomic built-in
    functions with 64-bit integer parameters and return types are not
    supported.

Issues

1. Should we extend atomic/barrier built-in functions by adding new
   parameters with default values to existing functions, or adding
   new/separate overloads?

   RESOLVED: New overloads, to avoid introducing a new language feature.

2. How hard should we try to informally document how the memory model works
   and how to use scope and semantics in this extension, vs. just leaving it
   to the Vulkan Memory Model spec?

   RESOLVED: It's not practical to repeat all the details of how these
   work, and it is hard to summarize without writing something that's
   strictly incorrect. Currently, this extension mostly leaves it to the
   other spec to give meaning to these parameters.

3. Should we add scope/semantics to all the RMW atomics?

   RESOLVED: Yes. It is nice to have these for completeness. Implementation-wise
   it should not be significant burden since all the atomics behave similarly.
   But it is potentially a lot of test writing.

4. Should we add workgroup coherence, i.e. an analog of the "coherent"
   decoration that only makes guarantees at workgroup scope?

   RESOLVED: Yes. This is a feature that exists in other APIs and can give
   better performance. It will also be added in a SPIR-V extension. We also
   add "subgroupcoherent" which only makes guarantees at subgroup scope.
