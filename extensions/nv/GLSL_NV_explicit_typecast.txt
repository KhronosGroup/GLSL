Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.50
    (#version 450) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.20
    (#version 320) and higher.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
    Specification, version 4.60.8, dated August 14, 2023.

    This extension interacts with GL_EXT_buffer_reference and 
    GL_EXT_buffer_reference_uvec2.

Overview

    This extension adds ability to convert expressions from one type
    to another using explicit typecasts in addition to the constructor syntax
    already present in GLSL.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following lines in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_NV_explicit_typecast : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

      #define GL_NV_explicit_typecast              1

    Modify Section 5.1, Operators, p. 112

    (add new entries to the precedence table; for a full spec, renumber the
    new precedence row "3.5" to "4", and renumber all subsequent rows)

    Precedence  Operator Class               Operators    Associativity
    ----------  --------------------------   ---------    -------------
      3.5       typecast                        ()        right to left    

    (modify the last paragraph, p.112, to delete language saying that
     typecast operators are not supported)  


    Modify Section 5.4, Constructors, p. 113

    (Insert after Section 5.4.2, Vector and Matrix Operations, p. 114)

    Section 5.11, Typecast Operations

    The typecast operator may be used to convert an expression from one type
    to another, operating in a manner similar to scalar, vector, and matrix
    constructors.  The typecast operator specifies a new data type in
    parentheses, followed by an expression.

    For scalar, vector, and matrix data types, the set of typecasts supported
    is equivalent to the set of single-operand constructors supported, and a
    typecast operates identically to an equivalent constructor.  A scalar
    expression may be typecast to any scalar, vector, or matrix data type.  A
    vector expression may be typecast to any vector type, except vectors with a
    larger number of components.  Additionally, four-component vector
    expressions may also be cast to a mat2 type.  A matrix expression may be
    typecast to any other matrix data type.

    Typecast operators are not supported for array or struct types.

    Typecast operators are also supported for buffer reference types and
    operates identically to an equivalent constructor converting from uint64_t
    or uvec2 or other buffer reference types as outlined in
    GL_EXT_buffer_reference or GL_EXT_buffer_reference_uvec2.

    Note that the typecast operator takes only a single expression.  Unlike
    constructors, they can not be used to generate a vector, structure, or
    matrix from multiple inputs.  For example,

      vec3 f = (vec3) (1.0, 2.0, 3.0);

    generates a three-component vector <f>.  But all three components
    are set to 3.0, which is the scalar value of the expression "(1.0, 2.0,
    3.0)".  The commas in that expression are sequence operators, not list
    delimiters.

Interactions with GL_EXT_buffer_reference, GL_EXT_buffer_reference_uvec2

    If GL_EXT_buffer_reference and GL_EXT_buffer_reference_uvec2 are not 
    supported, remove mention of typecasting to buffer reference types.
