Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.60
    (#version 460) and higher.

    This extension is written against revision 5 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.60, dated September 4, 2017.

    This extension interacts with revision 43 of the GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl
    extension, dated October 25, 2017.

Overview

    This extension document modifies GLSL to add new shader stages to support ray tracing.
    They are namely ray generation, intersection, any hit, closest hit, miss stages and
    callable collectively referred as ray tracing stages.

    This extension document adds support for the following extensions to be used
    within GLSL:

    - GL_NV_ray_tracing - enables ray tracing stages.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_NV_ray_tracing                          : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    New preprocessor #defines are added:

      #define GL_NV_ray_tracing                             1

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Overview of OpenGL Shading)

    Add Section 2.7, Ray Generation Processor

    The <ray generation processor> is a programmable unit that operates on an
    incoming ray and its associated data. It runs independently from other
    graphics and compute processors. Compilation units written in the
    OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called <ray
    generation shaders>. When a set of ray generation shaders are successfully
    compiled and linked, they result in a <ray generation executable> that
    runs on the ray generation processor.

    The ray generation processor is similar to the compute processor. It is
    used to execute ray tracing queries using traceNV() calls and process the
    results. It can pass data to other ray tracing stages through the ray
    payload.

    Add Section 2.8, Intersection Processor

    The <intersection processor> is a programmable unit that evaluates
    ray-primitive intersections and reports the results to other
    programmable units. It runs independently from other graphics and compute
    processors. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to
    run on this processor are called <intersection shaders>. When a set of
    intersection shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they result in
    an <intersection executable> that runs on the intersection processor.

    The intersection processor will use an implementation-specific built-in
    intersection shader if the ray query is operating on a triangle primitive.
    Otherwise, an application defined intersection shader is used if the ray
    query is operating on an axis-aligned bounding box. See the Ray Tracing
    chapter of the Vulkan specification for more information.

    The intersection processor operates on a single primitive at a time.

    The intersection processor can generate data that can be read by any-hit
    hit and closest-hit processors. The intersection processor cannot read or
    modify the ray payload.

    Add Section 2.9, Any-Hit Processor

    The <any-hit processor> is a programmable unit that operates on rays that
    have had intersections reported and evaluates whether the intersection
    should be accepted. It runs independently from other graphics and compute
    processors. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to
    run on this processor are called <any-hit shaders>. When a set of any-hit
    shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they result in an
    <any-hit executable> that runs on the any-hit processor.

    The order in which intersections are found along a ray, and therefore the
    order in which the any-hit processor is executed, is unspecified. The
    any-hit shader or the closest-hit must to be invoked at some point during
    traversal, unless the ray is forcibly terminated.

    Any-hit shaders have read-only access to the data generated by the
    intersection processor. They may read and modify the ray payload.

    The application may specify flags to avoid executing any-hit shaders for
    certain instances, primitives or rays in order to improve performance.

    Add Section 2.10, Closest-Hit Processor

    The <closest-hit processor> is a programmable unit that operates on rays
    that have had intersections reported. It runs independently from other
    graphics and compute processors. Compilation units written in the OpenGL
    Shading Language to run on this processor are called <closest-hit shaders>.
    When a set of closest-hit shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they
    result in a <closest-hit executable> that runs on the closest-hit processor.

    The closest-hit processor is executed at most one time when traversal is
    finished and an intersection has accepted.

    Closest hit shaders have read-only access to the data generated by the
    intersection processor. They may read and modify the ray payload. They can
    also recursively generate a new ray query through a call to traceNV().

    Add Section 2.11, Miss Processor

    The <miss processor> is a programmable unit that operates on rays that
    have not had any intersections reported by other programmable units. It
    runs independently from other graphics and compute processors. Compilation
    units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are
    called <miss shaders>. When a set of miss shaders are successfully
    compiled and linked, they result in a <miss executable> that runs on the
    miss processor.

    The miss processor is invoked instead of the closest-hit processor if no
    intersection is reported during traversal. Miss shaders can access the ray
    payload and can trace new rays through a call to traceNV(), but cannot
    access data generated by the intersection processor.

    Add Section 2.12, Callable Processor

    The <callable processor> is a programmable unit that operates on arbitrary
    data associated with a ray and invoked from other programmable units in the
    ray tracing pipeline. It is similar in concept to an indirect function call
    mechanism. It runs independently from other graphics and compute processors.
    Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor
    are called <callable shaders>.

    The callable processor can be invoked from a ray-generation, closest-hit, miss
    or another callable shader stage. They can only access data passed
    in to the callable from parent stage. They can be invoked by indexing into
    the shader binding table. Refer to Ray Tracing chapter of the Vulkan specification
    for further details.

    Types                           Meaning
    -----                           -------

    accelerationStructureNV         A handle representing acceleration structure
                                    used for calculating intersection of rays with
                                    geometry. Used only in a traceNV call.




    Add a new sub-section under Section 4.1.7 (Opaque Types)

    4.1.7.x Acceleration Structure Types

    accelerationStructureNV is an opaque type representing a structure used during
    ray tracing to accelerate queries of intersections of rays with scene geometry.
    It is declared and behaves like above described opaque types. When aggregated
    into arrays within a shader, accelerationStructureNV can only be indexed with
    a dynamically uniform integral expression, otherwise results are undefined.

    This type is used in traceNV builtin described in Section 8.19
    Members of structure cannot be declared with this type.


    Modify Section 4.3 (Storage Qualifiers)


    Storage Qualifier              Meaning
    -----------------              -------

    rayPayloadNV                   Ray generation, any-hit, closest-hit, and miss
                                   shader only. Storage associated with a ray
                                   can which can be written/read by downstream stages

    rayPayloadInNV                 Closest-hit, any-hit and miss shader only. Storage associated

                                   callable stage from invoking parent stage.


    Add a sub-section to Section 4.3 (Storage Qualifiers)

    4.3.X rayPayloadNV Variables

    These are allowed only in ray generation, any-hit, closest-hit, and miss
    shaders only. It is a compile time error to use them in any other stage.
    They can be both read and written to in ray generation, any-hit, closest-hit,
    and miss shaders. They cannot have any other storage qualifiers. It is a
    compile-time error to declare unsized arrays of this type.


    4.3.X hitAttributeNV Variables

    These are allowed only in intersection, any-hit, and closest-hit shaders.
    It is a compile-time error to use them in any other stage. They can be read
    in any-hit, and closest-hit shaders. They can be written to only in intersection
    shaders. There can be only a single variable at global scope with this qualifier
    in stages where this qualifier is permitted. If multiple variables are present,
    the results of reportIntersectionNV() are undefined. They cannot have any other
    storage qualifiers. It is a compile-time error to declare unsized arrays
    of this type.

    For the case of triangle geometry with no custom intersection shaders, any-hit and
    closest-hit shaders can access barycentric weights of the point of intersection of
    ray with triangle by declaring a hitAttributeNV variable of two 32-bit floating
    point elements

    For example, (either of)
        hitAttributeNV vec2 baryCoord;
        hitAttributeNV block { vec2 baryCoord; }
        hitAttributeNV float baryCoord[2];


    4.3.X rayPayloadInNV Variables

    These are allowed only in any-hit, closest-hit, and miss shaders only.
    It is a compile-time error to use them in any other stage.
    They can be read to and written in any-hit, closest-hit, and miss shaders
    There can be only a single variable at global scope with this qualifier in
    stages where this qualifier is permitted. If multiple variables are present
    results of accessing these variables are undefined.
    It is a compile-time error to declare unsized arrays of this type.


    4.3.X callableDataNV Variables

    These are allowed only in ray generation, closest-hit, miss and callable shaders
    only. It is a compile-time error to use them in any other stage. They can be
    both read and written to in supported stages. They cannot have any other storage
    qualifiers. It is a compile-time error to declare unsized arrays of this type.


    4.3.X callableDataInNV Variables

    These are allowed only in callable shaders. It is a compile-time error to use them
    in any other stage. They can be both read and written to in callable shaders. They
    cannot have any other storage qualifiers. There can be only a single variable
    at global scope with this qualifier. If multiple variables are present, result
    of accessing these variables is undefined. It is a compile-time error to declare
    unsized arrays of this type. Type of this variable must match the type of callableDataNV
    as passed by parent shader invoking this callable otherwise results are undefined.


    Add following to Section 4.3.4 (Input Variables)

    Ray tracing stages do not permit user defined input variables. They support
    some built-in inputs as described in Section 7. All other inputs are
    retrieved explicitly from image loads, texture fetches, loads from
    uniform or storage buffers, or other user supplied code. It is
    illegal to redeclare these built-in input variables.


    Add following to Section 4.3.6 (Output Variables)

    Ray tracing stages do not have any built-in outputs nor permit any user
    defined output variables.


    Add following to Section 4.3.8 (Shared Variables)

    Ray tracing stages do not permit declaring variables with 'shared' storage
    qualifier.



    Add the following to Section 4.3.9 (Interface Blocks)

    "Input, output, uniform, *rayPayloadNV, *rayPayloadInNV*, *hitAttributeNV*,
    *callableDataNV*, *callableDataInNV* and buffer variable declarations can
    be grouped into named interface blocks..."

    "It is compile time error to use input, output or patch interface qualifier
    for blocks in ray tracing shader stages"


    Modify table in Section 4.4 (Layout Qualifiers)

    Add new sub-section to Section 4.4

    4.4.X rayPayloadNV Layout Qualifiers

    The layout qualifiers are :

    layout-qualifier-id :
        location = integer-constant-expression

    Non-block variables declared with these qualifiers must have a valid location
    layout qualifier. For interface blocks, only top level block declaration can
    have valid location layout qualifier. It is illegal to have layout qualifier
    on members of the block.

    4.4.X rayPayloadInNV Layout Qualifiers

    The layout qualifiers are :

    layout-qualifier-id :
        location = integer-constant-expression

    Non-block variables declared with these qualifiers must have a valid location
    layout qualifier. For interface blocks, only top level block declaration can
    have valid location layout qualifier. It is illegal to have layout qualifier
    on members of the block.

    4.4.X hitAttributeNV Layout Qualifiers

    No layout qualifiers are allowed on variables of this type.

    4.4.X callableDataNV Layout Qualifiers

    The layout qualifiers are :

    layout-qualifier-id :
        location = integer-constant-expression

    Non-block variables declared with these qualifiers must have a valid location
    layout qualifier. For interface blocks, only top level block declaration can
    have valid location layout qualifier. It is illegal to have layout qualifier
    on members of the block.

    4.4.X callableDataInNV Layout Qualifiers

    The layout qualifiers are :

    layout-qualifier-id :
        location = integer-constant-expression

    Non-block variables declared with these qualifiers must have a valid location
    layout qualifier. For interface blocks, only top level block declaration can
    have valid location layout qualifier. It is illegal to have layout qualifier
    on members of the block.

    Add to end of section 4.4.5, Uniform and Shader Storage Block Layout Qualifiers

    The "shaderRecordNV" qualifier is used to declare a buffer block and represents a
    buffer within a shader record as defined in the API in Ray Tracing chapter of the Vulkan
    specification. It is supported only in ray tracing stages. It is a compile-time error
    to apply this to any block type other than buffer. A buffer block declared with
    layout(shaderRecordNV) can be optionally declared with an instance. There can be only
    one shaderRecordNV buffer block per stage otherwise a link/compile time error will be
    generated. It is a compile time error to use layout qualifiers such as binding and set
    along with shaderRecordNV. These blocks are initialized by a separate API as specified
    in Ray Tracing chapter of the Vulkan specification.

    more details.


    Add the following description for gl_WorldRayOriginNV, gl_WorldRayDirectionNV,
    gl_ObjectRayOriginNV, and gl_ObjectRayDirectionNV:

    The variables gl_WorldRayOriginNV, gl_WorldRayDirectionNV, gl_ObjectRayOriginNV,
    and gl_ObjectRayDirectionNV are available in the intersection, any-hit,
    closest-hit, and miss shaders to specify the origin and direction of the
    ray being processed in both world and object space respectively.

    Add the following description for gl_RayTminNV and gl_RayTmaxNV:

    The variables gl_RayTminNV and gl_RayTmaxNV are available in the intersection,
    any-hit, closest-hit, and miss shaders to specify the parametric <Tmin>
    and <Tmax> values of the ray being processed. The values are independent
    of the space in which the ray and origin exist.

    The <Tmin> value remains constant for the duration of the ray query, while
    the <Tmax> value changes throughout the lifetime of the ray query that
    produced the intersection. In the closest-hit shader, the value reflects
    the closest distance to the intersected primitive. In the any-hit shader,
    it reflects the distance to the primitive currently being intersected. In
    the intersection shader, it reflects the distance to the closest primitive
    intersected so far. The value can change in the intersection shader after
    calling reportIntersectionNV() if the corresponding any hit shader does not
    ignore the intersection. In a miss shader, the value is identical to the
    parameter passed into traceNV().

    Add the following description for gl_IncomingRayFlagsNV:

    gl_IncomingRayFlagsNV is available in intersection, closest-hit, any-hit, miss,
    and callable shaders to specify the current ray's flags as passed via the 'rayflags'
    argument of traceNV() call resulting in invocation of current shader stage.

    Add the following description for gl_HitTNV:

    gl_HitTNV is available only in the any-hit and closest-hit shaders. This is an
    alias of gl_RayTmaxNV added to closest-hit and any-hit shaders for convenience.


    Add the following description for gl_HitKindNV:

    gl_HitKindNV is available in the any hit and closest hit languages to
    describe the intersection that triggered the execution of the current
    shader. Values are sent from the intersection shader.

    Add the following description for gl_ObjectToWorldNV and
    gl_WorldToObjectNV:

    The matrices gl_ObjectToWorldNV and gl_WorldToObjectNV are available in the
    intersection, any-hit, and closest-hit shaders to specify the current
    object-to-world and world-to-object transformation matrices respectively, which are
    determined by the instance of the current intersection. See the Ray Tracing
    chapter of the Vulkan specification for more details.


    Add a new subsection 7.3.2, "Fixed Constants"

    The following constants are provided in all ray tracing shader stages

    const uint gl_RayFlagsNoneNV = 0U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsOpaqueNV = 1U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsNoOpaqueNV = 2U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsTerminateOnFirstHitNV = 4U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsSkipClosestHitShaderNV = 8U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsCullBackFacingTrianglesNV = 16U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsCullFrontFacingTrianglesNV = 32U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsCullOpaqueNV = 64U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsCullNoOpaqueNV = 128U;

    These can be used as flags for the 'rayflags' argument for traceNV call,
    or for comparing value to gl_IncomingRayFlagsNV.

Additions to Chapter 8 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Built-in Functions)

    Add Section 8.19, Ray Tracing Functions

    Syntax:

        void traceNV(accelerationStructureNV topLevel,
                   uint rayFlags,
                   uint cullMask,
                   uint sbtRecordOffset,
                   uint sbtRecordStride,
                   uint missIndex,
                   vec3 origin,
                   float Tmin,
                   vec3 direction,
                   float Tmax,
                   int payload);

    This function is only available in the ray generation, closest hit, and
    miss shaders.

    Initiates a ray query against a top-level <accelerationStructureNV>
    structure, triggering the execution of various intersection and any-hit
    shaders as ray-geometry intersections are being evaluated, and finally
    the execution of either a closest-hit or miss shader, depending on whether
    an intersection was found.

    The ray's origin and direction are specified by <origin> and <direction>,
    and the valid parametric range on which intersections can occur is
    specified by <Tmin> and <Tmax>.

    <rayFlags> is any combination of built-in constants as defined in
    Section 7.3 "Built-In Constants".

    <cullMask> is an 8 bit mask which specifies the instances to be intersected
    i.e visible to the traced ray. This mask will be combined with the mask field
    specified in VkGeometryInstanceNV as defined in the Ray Tracing chapter of Vulkan
    Specification using a bitwise AND operation. The instance is visible only if
    the result of the operation is non-zero. The upper 24 bits of this value are
    ignored. If the value is zero, no instances are visible.

    Associated with the ray is <payload> which is a compile-time constant to select
    a shader defined structure containing data that will be passed to other
    shader stages. This can be accessed for reading and writing by each any-hit shader
    invoked along the ray, and by the miss or closest-hit shader at the end of the query.
    It is possible for a shader to contain multiple invocations of traceNV() using
    different payload types, as long as the shaders executed in the trace call have
    defined compatible payload types. Different payload types are chosen based on
    the different values of the compile-time constant <payload> which correspond the
    the rayPayload/rayPayloadIn qualified variables having the same value for the
    location layout qualifier.

    The <sbtRecordOffset> and <sbtRecordStride> parameters influence the
    computation of record indices of the <shader binding table> that locate
    the intersection, any-hit, and closest-hit shaders during a trace query. See
    the Ray Tracing chapter of the Vulkan specification for more information.

    The <missIndex> parameter influences computation of indices into the
    <shader binding table> to locate a miss shader during a trace query. See
    the Ray Tracing chapter of the vulkan specification for more information.

    Syntax:

        bool reportIntersectionNV(float hitT, uint hitKind);

    This function is only available in intersection shaders.

    Invokes the current hit shader once an intersection shader has determined
    that a ray intersection has occurred. If the intersection occurred within
    the current ray interval, the any hit shader corresponding to the current
    intersection shader is invoked. If the intersection is not ignored in the
    any-hit shader, <hitT> is committed as the new gl_RayTmaxNV value of the
    current ray and <hitKind> is committed as the new value for gl_HitKindNV.

    Syntax:

        void ignoreIntersectionNV();

    This function is only available in an any-hit shader.

    Terminates the calling any-hit shader and continues the ray query without
    modifying gl_RayTmaxNV and gl_HitKindNV.

    Syntax:

        void terminateRayNV();

    This function is only available in an any-hit shader.

    Terminates the calling any-hit shader and stops the ray query. It commits
    the hitT as the new gl_RayTmaxNV value of the current ray query, and hitKind as
    the new value for gl_HitKindNV. It then invokes the current closest-hit
    shader.

    Syntax:

        void executeCallableNV(uint sbtRecordIndex, int callable)

    This function is available only in ray generation, closest-hit, miss, and
    callable stage. Invokes the callable located at 'sbtRecordIndex' in the
    shader binding table. Refer to Ray Tracing chapter of Vulkan specification
    for details.

    <callable> is a compile-time constant used to select an shader defined structure
    containing data that will be passed to a callable shader stage and can be accessed
    for reading and writing by the callable. It is possible for a shader to contain
    multiple invocations of executeCallableNV() using different types, as long as the
    shaders executed in the callable have defined compatible callableDataInNV types.
    Different callable data types are chosen based on the different values of the
    compile-time constant <callable> which corresponds to callableDataNV/callableDataInNV
    qualified variables having the same value for the location layout qualifier.


    Example :


    Ray Generation Shader :

    #version 460 core
    #extension GL_NV_ray_tracing : enable
    layout(location = 0) rayPayloadNV vec4 payload;
    layout(location = 0) callableDataNV float blendColor;
    layout(binding = 0, set = 0) uniform accelerationStructureNV acc;
    layout(binding = 1, rgba32f) uniform image2D img;
    layout(binding = 1, set = 0) uniform rayParams
    {
        vec3 rayOrigin;
        vec3 rayDir;
        uint sbtOffset;
        uint sbtStride;
        uint missIndex;
        uint callableSbtIndex;
    };
    vec3 computeDir(vec3 inDir) {
        inDir.x = inDir.x + float(gl_LaunchIDNV.x / gl_LaunchSizeNV.x);
        inDir.y = inDir.y + float(gl_LaunchIDNV.y / gl_LaunchSizeNV.y);
        return inDir;
    }
    void main()
    {
       vec4 imgColor = vec4(0);
       traceNV(acc, gl_RayFlagsOpaqueNV, 0xff, sbtOffset,
                    sbtStride, missIndex, rayOrigin, 0.0,
                    computeDir(rayDir), 100.0f, 0 /* payload */);
       executeCallable(callableSbtIndex, 0 /* blendColor */);
       imgColor = payload + vec4(blendColor) ;
       imageStore(img, ivec2(gl_LaunchIDNV), imgColor);

    }

    Callable Shader:

    #version 460 core
    #extension GL_NV_ray_tracing : enable
    layout(location = 0) callableDataInNV float outColor;
    layout(shaderRecordNV) buffer block
    {
         uint blendWeight;
    }
    void main()
    {
        outColor = float((blendWeight.x >> 5U) & 0x7U + blendWeight.y & 0x3U);
    }


Issues

    1) Do we need to specify the GL_NV_ray_tracing as enabled for these new
       shader stages?

       RESOLVED : Yes, needs to be specified in shaders.

    2) How are we going to specify callable shaders?

       RESOLVED : Callables are implemented as a separate shader stage.

    3) Where should we define GLSL flags that are used to define ray types and
       built in hit kinds?

       RESOLVED : Added them as built-in constants to Section 7.3

    4) Should we allow type polymorphism in the traceNV() call for the ray
       payload?

       RESOLVED : GLSL does not allow usage of templates, traceNV() builtin has
       last argument as 'int payload'. This corresponds to location qualifier
       assigned to any rayPayloadNV qualified variables which in turn allows
       dispatching traceNV calls with different payload types.

    5) Where should we specify how attribute data is passed between the
       different ray tracing stages?

       RESOLVED: rayPayloadNV/rayPayloadInNV/hitAttributeNV/callableDataNV
                 callableDataInNV

    6) This extension adds gl_InstanceID for the intersection, any hit, and
       closest hit shaders, but in KHR_vulkan_glsl, gl_InstanceID is replaced
       with gl_InstanceIndex. Which should be used for Vulkan in this
       extension?

       RESOLVED: This extension uses gl_InstanceID and maps it to InstanceId
       in SPIR-V. It is acknowledged that this is different than other shader
       stages in Vulkan. There are two main reasons for the difference here:
       - symmetry with gl_PrimitiveID which is also available in these shaders
       - there is no "baseInstance" relevant for these shaders, and so ID makes
         it more obvious that this is zero-based.
