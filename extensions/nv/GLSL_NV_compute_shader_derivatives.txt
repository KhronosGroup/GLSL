    Specification, version 4.60, dated July 23, 2017.

Overview

    In unextended OpenGL, the GLSL shading language supports derivatives in
    fragment shaders, which are computed on shader inputs or on other computed
    values using fragments' (x,y) coordinates as the domain.  Derivatives are
    not supported in any other shader stage.  However, compute shaders also
    arrange shader invocations in a three-dimensional array with (x,y,z)
    coordinates.  This extension provides a mechanism where compute shaders
    can similarly evaluate derivatives using the x and y coordinates of the
    local invocation ID across a set of invocations with identical z
    coordinates.

    This extension, when enabled, allows applications to use derivatives in
    compute shaders.  It adds compute shader support for built-in derivative
    functions like dFdx(), automatic level of detail computation in
    texture lookup functions like texture(), use of the optional LOD bias
    parameter to adjust the computed level of detail values in texture lookup
    functions, and the texture level of detail query function
    textureQueryLod().

    The extension provides new layout qualifiers that support two different
    arrangements of compute shader invocations for the purpose of derivative
    computation.  When specifying

      layout(derivative_group_quadsNV) in;

    compute shader invocations are grouped into 2x2x1 arrays whose four local
    invocation ID values follow the pattern:

        +-----------------+------------------+
        | (2x+0, 2y+0, z) |  (2x+1, 2y+0, z) |
        +-----------------+------------------+
        | (2x+0, 2y+1, z) |  (2x+1, 2y+1, z) |
        +-----------------+------------------+

    where Y increases from bottom to top.  When specifying

      layout(derivative_group_linearNV) in;

    compute shader invocations are grouped into 2x2x1 arrays whose four local
    invocation index values follow the pattern:

        +------+------+
        | 4n+0 | 4n+1 |
        +------+------+
        | 4n+2 | 4n+3 |
        +------+------+

    If neither layout qualifier is specified, derivatives in compute shaders
    return zero, which is consistent with the handling of built-in texture
    functions like texture() in GLSL 4.50 compute shaders.

    Unlike fragment shaders, compute shaders never have any "helper"
    invocations that are only used for derivatives.  As a result, the local
    work group width and height must be a multiple of two when using the
    "quads" layout, and the total number of invocations in a local work group
    must be a multiple of four when using the "linear" layout.

    Mapping to SPIR-V
    -----------------

    For informational purposes (non-normative), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs:

      derivative_group_quadsNV layout qualifier -> DerivativeGroupQuadsNV Execution Mode
      derivative_group_linearNV layout qualifier -> DerivativeGroupLinearNV Execution Mode

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.50

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_NV_compute_shader_derivatives : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    A new preprocessor #define is added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

      #define GL_NV_compute_shader_derivatives          1


    Modify Section 4.4, Layout Qualifiers, p. 56

    (add to supported layout qualifier table, pp. 57-58)

                               Qualifier  Individual        Block   Allowed
    Layout Qualifier             Only      Variable   Block Member  Interfaces
    -------------------------  ---------  ----------  ----- ------  ----------
    derivative_group_quadsNV       X          -         -      -    compute in
    derivative_group_linearNV      X          -         -      -    compute in


    Modify Section 4.4.1.4, Compute Shader Inputs, p. 66

    (add support for new layout qualifiers, p. 66)

    layout-qualifier-id:
        ...
        derivative_group_quadsNV
        derivative_group_linearNV

    ...

    (insert at the end of the section)

    The "derivative_group_quadsNV" and "derivative_group_linearNV" qualifiers
    are used to specify how compute shader invocations are grouped for the
    purposes of evaluating derivatives for derivative functions and automatic
    texture level of detail computation.  It is a compile-time error if both
    qualifiers are specified.  If neither qualifier is specified, derivatives
    evaluated for compute shaders will return zero.

    The layout qualifier "derivative_group_quadsNV" specifies that derivatives
    in compute shaders are evaluated over 2x2 groups of invocations whose
    gl_LocalInvocationID values are of the form (2x+{0,1}, 2y+{0,1}, z).  It
    is a compile-time error if this qualifier is used with a local group size
    whose first or second dimension is not a multiple of two.

    The layout qualifier "derivative_group_linearNV" specifies that
    derivatives in compute shaders are evaluated over groups of four
    invocations with consecutive gl_LocalInvocationIndex values of the form
    4x+{0,1,2,3}.  It is a compile-time error if this qualifier is used with a
    local group size whose total number of invocations is not a multiple of
    four.


    Modify Section 8.9, Texture Functions, p. 162

    (modify first paragraph of the section, p. 162, to document that automatic
     level of detail calculations are now supported in compute shaders and to
     refer to the derivatives section for more information on how derivatives
     are evaluated)

    Texture lookup functions are available in all shading stages.  However,
    automatic level of detail computations are performed only for fragment and
    compute shaders, using derivative computations described in Section
    8.13.1.  Other shaders...

    (modify first paragraph, p. 163, to allow LOD bias in compute shaders)

    In all functions below, the <bias> parameter is optional for fragment and
    compute shaders.  ... For a fragment or compute shader, if <bias> is
    present, it is added...

    (modify third paragraph, p. 163 - Use "automatic level of detail
     calculation" as in prior language instead of "implicit derivatives".
     Additionally, drop the "undefined in non-fragment" langauge, since we
     already defined that case to use zero for the level of detail.)

    Some texture functions (non-"Lod" and non-"Grad" versions) may require
    automatic level of detail calculations.  The computed level of detail is
    undefined within non-uniform control flow.


    Modify Section 8.9.1, Texture Query Functions, p. 163

    (modify second paragraph of section, p. 163, to allow LOD queries in
    compute shaders)

    The textureQueryLod functions are available only in fragment and compute
    shaders. ...


    Modify Section 8.13, Fragment Processing Functions, p. 184

    (If this is added to a full specification, sub-section 8.13.1, "Derivative
     Functions" should be lifted into its own section, since they are also
     available in compute shaders.  For the purposes of this extension, we
     simply modify the introductory text in this section.)

    Other than derivative functions, fragment processing functions are only
    available in fragment shaders.  Derivative functions are available in both
    fragment and compute shaders.


    Modify Section 8.13.1, Derivative Functions, p. 184

    (add introductory text to the beginning of the section)

    Derivative functions are available in fragment and compute shaders, and
    are used to evaluate derivatives of values computed in these shaders over
    a two-dimensional domain.  For fragment shaders, derivatives are taken
    relative to the (x,y) coordinates of the associated fragments.  For
    compute shaders, derivatives are evaluated over groups of four invocations
    arranged in a 2x2 grid.

    (add discussion of how derivatives are evaluated in compute shaders,
     before the next-to-last paragraph, "In some implementations", p. 185)

    Unlike fragment shader invocations, compute shader invocations don't have
    associated screen-space (x,y) coordinates to use as a domain for
    derivatives.  Derivatives in compute shaders will be evaluated using
    differencing over groups of four shader invocations.  When the
    "derivative_group_quadsNV" layout qualifier is specified in a compute
    shader, derivatives will be evaluated over groups of four invocations
    whose gl_LocalInvocationID values are of the form (2x+m, 2y+n, z), where
    <x>, <y>, and <z> are integers, and <m> and <n> must be zero or one.  When
    the "derivative_group_linearNV" layout qualifier is specified, derivatives
    will be evaluated over groups of four invocations whose
    gl_LocalInvocationIndex values are of the form 4x+2n+m, where <x> is an
    integer and <m> and <n> must be zero or one.  If neither
    "derivative_group_quadsNV" nor "derivative_group_linearNV" is specified,
    derivatives in a compute shader return zero.

    Invocations in each group of four compute shader invocations are assigned
    (x,y) coordinates of (m,n), where values of <m> and <n> are zero or one as
    described above.  If F(m,n) specifies the value of F for the invocation at
    (m,n), fine derivatives with respect to <x> for an invocation at (m,n) are
    evaluated as

      F(1,n) - F(0,n)

    while fine derivatives with respect to <y> are evaluated as

      F(m,1) - F(m,0).

    As in fragment shaders, coarse derivatives in compute shaders may evaluate
    a single value for each group of four invocations.


Dependencies on ARB_sparse_texture2

    If ARB_sparse_texture2 is supported, the texture lookup functions provided
    by that extension will support automatic level of detail computation in
    compute shaders, as defined in this extension.  Supported functions
    include:

      sparseTextureARB (with or without LOD bias)
      sparseTextureOffsetARB (with or without LOD bias)

    The following functions using derivatives provided by the shader were
    already supported in compute shaders prior to this extension:

      sparseTextureGradARB
      sparseTextureGradOffsetARB

Dependencies on ARB_sparse_texture_clamp

    If ARB_sparse_texture_clamp is supported, the texture lookup functions
    provided by that extension will support automatic level of detail
    computation in compute shaders, as defined in this extension.  Supported
    functions include:

      sparseTextureClampARB (with or without LOD bias)
      textureClampARB (with or without LOD bias)
      sparseTextureOffsetClampARB (with or without LOD bias)
      textureOffsetClampARB (with or without LOD bias)

    The following functions using derivatives provided by the shader were
    already supported in compute shaders prior to this extension:

      sparseTextureGradClampARB
      textureGradClampARB
      sparseTextureGradOffsetClampARB
      textureGradOffsetClampARB

Dependencies on KHR_shader_subgroup

    If the KHR_shader_subgroup_quads feature of KHR_shader_subgroup is
    supported, add the following language describing the mapping of
    invocations to subgroup "quads" in compuote shaders.  This language should
    be added immediately after similar language for fragment shaders that
    begins with "In fragment shaders, this quad corresponds to 4 pixels
    arranged in a 2x2 grid".

      In compute shaders using the "derivative_group_quadsNV" or
      "derivative_group_linearNV" layout qualifier, this quad corresponds to
      4 invocations arranged in a 2x2 grid:

          0 | 1
          --|--
          2 | 3

      When using "derivative_group_quadsNV", the four invocations are arranged
      such that:

      - 0th index has a local invocation ID of the form (2x + 0, 2y + 0, z)
      - 1st index has a local invocation ID of the form (2x + 1, 2y + 0, z)
      - 2nd index has a local invocation ID of the form (2x + 0, 2y + 1, z)
      - 3rd index has a local invocation ID of the form (2x + 1, 2y + 1, z)

      for some integer values <x>, <y>, and <z>.  When using
      "derivative_group_linearNV", the four invocations are arranged such
      that:

      - 0th index has a local invocation index of the form 4n + 0
      - 1st index has a local invocation index of the form 4n + 1
      - 2nd index has a local invocation index of the form 4n + 2
      - 3rd index has a local invocation index of the form 4n + 3

      for some integer value <n>.

Issues

    (1) Should we provide support for "helper" invocations like we have for
        fragment shaders?

      RESOLVED:  No, we are not providing any support for automatic "helper"
      compute shader invocations that would be spawned solely for the purpose
      of computing derivatives.  When using this feature, the local work group
      must be fully decomposable into 2x2 "quads" to ensure well-defined
      derivatives.  Using odd local work group sizes in compute shaders
      requiring derivatives is not allowed and will result in compile-time
      errors.  If the natural size of a work group is not a multiple of the
      2x2 "quad" size, applications can introduce their own "helper"
      invocations by padding the workgroup size to a multiple of two and
      manually ensuring that the "extra" invocations don't have unwanted side
      effects (e.g., undesired writes to memory).

    (2) What mechanisms should we provide to control the packing of compute
        shader invocations into "quads" for differencing purposes?

      RESOLVED:  We provide two different options, which can be specified via
      layout qualifier.

      The most natural way to support derivatives is to take the
      already-existing (x,y,z) coordinates in gl_LocalInvocationID and use the
      (x,y) coordinates as the domain.  In this model, mapping to the
      "derivative_group_quadsNV" layout qualifier, we simply arrange invocations
      into 2x2 "quads" with coordinates of the form (2m+{0,1}, 2n+{0,1}, z).

      The "quads" approach might not work for all use cases that require
      derivative support.  For example, a shader might want to just use a
      one-dimensional array of invocations and provide its own interpretation
      of how each invocation maps to an (x,y) coordinate in the domain.  To
      support this model, we provide the "derivative_group_linearNV" layout
      qualifier, where invocations are arranged into groups of four with
      one-dimensional gl_LocalInvocationIndex values of the form 4n+{0,1,2,3}.
      Shaders using this layout qualifier need to ensure that (x,y)
      coordinates used to evaluate the inputs of derivative functions for each
      invocation in a group are chosen so that differencing-based derivatives
      make sense.

    (3) Which texture built-in functions automatically compute derivatives
        with this extension?

      RESOLVED:  In the core profile, computed derivatives are supported for
      all functions that compute derivatives in fragment shaders:  texture(),
      textureProj(), textureOffset(), textureProjOffset().  If the
      compatibility profile is supported, the old legacy built-in functions
      should also compute derivatives:

        texture1D(), texture1DProj(), texture2D(), texture2DProj(),
        texture3D(), texture3DProj(), textureCube(), shadow1D(), shadow2D(),
        shadow1DProj(), and shadow2DProj().

      This extension also produces defined derivatives in texture lookup
      functions from ARB_sparse_texture2 and ARB_sparse_texture_clamp.

    (4) How are derivatives handled when no "derviative_group" layout
        qualifier is specified?  How are derivatives handled in divergent flow
        control?

      RESOLVED:  When no layout qualifier is specified, derivatives evaluated
      in compute shaders for derivative functions and automatic level of
      detail computations will return zero.  While derivative functions (e.g.,
      dFdx) were not supported in compute shaders prior to this extension, the
      same texture lookup functions that would use derivatives for automatic
      level of detail computation when called in fragment shaders were
      supported in compute shaders.  In those functions, the base level of
      detail (zero) is supposed to be used, which is consistent with the
      derivatives of zero we specify here.

      In divergent flow control, not all of the four invocations in a given
      derivative group may be active.  The values used for derivatives may not
      have been computed for inactive threads, so differencing will produce
      incorrect results.  While this situation produces undefined results for
      fragment shaders in the core GLSL specification, NVIDIA's hardware
      implementation will recognize divergence and produce derivatives of
      zero.
